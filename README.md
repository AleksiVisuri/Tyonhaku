Hi, my name is Aleksi Visuri, and I use this repository as a tool to find a workplace in the game development industry.

# Dark Office
## Last week, our group made a horror game in a game jam.

# Pullo Pale
About a year ago, we did a group project about a bottle that came to life. We have done the graphics from scratch (Note! that the 2 figures that my friends added as a joke are not done by ourselves (the ones that are as a background and the one in main menu)) and had our struggles with the code and Unity as well. There is a bug(s) still that we haven't had time to fix, see if you can find them! (P.S to enable fullscreen, you have to navigate/scroll to the bottom right corner!)

The Sripts of the project can be found in the Pullopale Folder via Scripts: https://github.com/AleksiVisuri/Tyonhaku/tree/main/Scripts/Pullopale
(I am not claiming that I did all the work by myself, the credit goes also towards Eemil and Jesse: https://github.com/EemilKemppainen , https://github.com/JesseHamutta)

Also through the journey we have had individual projects taught by our teachers or some Unity-ready courses. Something to note that the assets/graphics aren't done by myself. I have done these projects for educational purposes only. Basically what we had to do is that we had to understand how the environment works and how to code it (heh) + do a little modifications through out the challenges. Biggest challenges propably were the own adaptation of the projects, and how to solve them. The time it took, was propably worth it, but looking back now, I should have had it done in a lesser timestamp. Have fun exploring these projects!

I like music as a hobby in my spare time, which includes playing music, listening to music, and doing music. I hang out with my friends as often as possible. As an excercising hobby I do sports like running and orienteering, but my past hobbies include various team and not so team based hobbies. Most honorable mention goes to games. I spend most of my time playing them or trying to make them. Right now we are trying to make a new game in school in groups. Our group makes a multiplayer game where player is against another player where the other player has joined the host's server. We'll see if we can succesfully make this come true. To see our current progress, take a look to our repository: (link will be added)
