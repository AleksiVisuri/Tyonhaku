Hi, my name is Aleksi Visuri, and I use this repository as a tool to find a workplace in the game development industry.

About a year ago, we did a group project about a bottle that came to life. We have done the graphics from scratch (Note! that the 2 figures that my friends added as a joke are not done by ourselves (the ones that are as a background and the one in main menu)) and had our struggles with the code and Unity as well. There is a bug(s) still that we haven't had time to fix, see if you can find them!

Also through the journey we have had individual projects taught by our teachers or some Unity-ready courses. Something to note that the assets/graphics aren't done by myself. I have done these projects for educational purposes only. Basically what we had to do is that we had to understand how the environment works and how to code it (heh) + do a little modifications through out the challenges. Biggest challenges propably were the own adaptation of the projects, and how to solve them. The time it took, was propably worth it, but looking back now, I should have had it done in a lesser timestamp. Have fun exploring these projects!

I like to play games in my free time, and I have been part of a Finnish community, with passion for games such as Brawl Stars, which is a mobile game. From there we have expanded to various titles and games, what whoever might be playing at the time. I have had my part of leading a smaller portion of the community in Brawl Stars. It has been fun and I still chat regurarly with my fellow mates.
